LaTeX Support
==============

If you want to enter LaTeX code and have it rendered, you need to install
the texlive extension:

    flatpak install flathub org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.texlive//23.08
    
Templates are available, although they are a bit hidden:

    /var/lib/flatpak/app/com.github.xournalpp.xournalpp/current/active/files/share/xournalpp/resources/default_template.tex
    
Optionally, you can download an additional copy right from here:

    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/master/resources/default_template.tex
